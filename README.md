# Prediction-of-Heart-Failure-Using-a-Combination-of-Machine-Learning-AutoML
The correct prediction of heart disease can prevent life threats, and incorrect prediction can prove to be fatal at the same time. In this paper different machine learning algorithms and H20 AutoML are applied to compare the results and analysis of the Machine Learning Heart Disease dataset.
